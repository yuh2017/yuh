        <h2>                 </h2>
        <p>Welcome! I am Yu Han. I hold a Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Florida (UF), along with master's degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UF and Civil and Environmental Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. I earned my bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China.

        <p>I am currently a research associate at the Department of Land Economy at University of Cambridge. Previously, I served as an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation at the University of Twente. Between 2021 and 2022, I held postdoctoral positions in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning at Texas A&M University and the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am on the job market, seeking roles that align with my expertise in climate adaptation, urban planning, and coastal risk assessment. My research focuses on developing human-centered computational methods to evaluate community risks posed by natural disasters, such as coastal storm surges. I am particularly passionate about employing data-driven models and simulation approaches to analyze human behavior and decision-making in response to climate change.</p>

        <p>My recent projects focus on assessing the indirect impacts of compound and cascading hazards in the US and Europe. My work has been published in prestigious journals such as Risk Analysis; the Journal of Environmental Management; Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems; the Journal of Planning Literature; Cities; Climatic Change; and Sustainability and Sustainable Cities and Society, et al.</p>

        <p>I teach courses on Climate Change and Adaptation Planning, Geoinformation Science for Digital Planning, Quantitative Risk Assessment, and Land Use and Transportation Modeling to both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>

       
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy running, family time, and traveling.</p>
