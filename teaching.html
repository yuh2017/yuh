        <p>My teaching approach is informed by my extensive experiences in education, supervising, and collaborating with scholars from diverse disciplines. Through these experiences, I have developed and refined methods that enable students from diverse cultural and educational backgrounds to maximize their learning. As an interdisciplinary scholar to bridge social and natural systems, the foundation of my teaching philosophy is to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment and promote critical thinking that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries through active engagement and integrating theories, methods, and policies.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the increasing complexity and uncertainty of climate adaptation issues, my goal is to prepare future urban planners and researchers who are equipped to understand and address these challenges using a multifaceted toolkit. My research interests span climate change and adaptation policy, resilient cities and communities, land use and transportation modeling, and urban geoinformation science. I aim to incorporate these themes into interdisciplinary lectures, workshops, and seminars tailored to the specific needs of different institutions. By doing so, I ensure that my teaching is both relevant and responsive to the evolving landscape of urban planning and policy.</p>

            This course focuses on the analysis of risk and its applications in decision-making across various phases of disaster management. Students will gain a multidisciplinary understanding of hazards, including their types, frequency, intensity, and modeling methods. The curriculum covers elements-at-risk, focusing on their types, classification, data collection, and quantification. It also examines vulnerabilities in social, environmental, and institutional perspectives, as well as capacities and adaptations necessary for prediction, coping, and recovery.
            Key topics include risk management from diverse stakeholder perspectives, utilizing risk information for risk reduction planning, and performing cost-benefit analyses in scenario-based adaptation planning. The course also explores the application of risk information in early warning systems, damage assessment methods, and the use of this information in disaster reconstruction planning. 
            Additionally, students will study the impacts of climate change, population growth, and land-use changes on natural hazard risk. This comprehensive approach equips students with the knowledge and tools to effectively manage and mitigate risks in a changing world.

            </p>
            <p>This is a graduate-level course addresses the pressing global challenges of the 21st century, including those related to climate change, urban sprawl, and increased resource consumption. The course aims to enhance students' awareness of the urgency to tackle these issues across multiple scales and emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approach to address them.

            Key global challenges will be introduced through a series of lectures. Afterward, students will select topics of interest, form groups, and conduct in-depth analyses of specific global issues. This collaborative effort will involve designing local adaptation strategies, plans, and policy recommendations to address these challenges.

            Throughout the course, students will also develop essential geoinformation techniques and acquire specialized knowledge to effectively manage these problems at the local level. </p>

            <p>This is a graduate level course that introduces students to the principles and techniques of modeling land use and transportation system. It focuses on the methods used to analyze and predict the impacts of transportation policies on urban development and the interactions between land use and transportation demand. The course will introduce students theories, methods, case studies of travel demand modeling(trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and route assignment), land use modeling (econometric models, spatial interaction models, and integrated land use-transportation models) and activity-based models (activity generation, activity scheduling, tour formation, etc.). The course includes hands-on lab sessions to understand these modeling processes.</p>
